                    This ramen recipe uses the ever-popular brand of Buldak ramen that has been praised by many for its flavor and spice and ppopularized by k-pop idols on tour. We spruce it up with a bunch of cheese and some hot dogs. And last but not least to any ramen recipe: the <strong>soft-boiled eggs!</strong> This is perfect for Korean muckbang watching or a rainy day.
